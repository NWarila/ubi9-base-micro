# Technical Debt

## TD-4: Red Hat UBI direct-CDN blob availability

Red Hat UBI repository metadata can purge older z-stream RPM builds while this
image still needs exact NEVRA pins for byte-for-byte reproducibility and FIPS
scope. The runtime lock therefore records a direct `https://cdn-ubi.redhat.com/`
URL plus whole-RPM SHA-256 for every runtime RPM, including the held
`openssl-fips-provider` / `openssl-fips-provider-so` `3.0.7-8.el9` packages and
ordinary transaction RPMs such as `coreutils`, `coreutils-common`, and
`libtasn1`.

This removes the known metadata-purge failure mode, but it does not make CDN blob
retention a permanent guarantee. The nightly rebuild is the purge sentinel: a
404, whole-RPM SHA mismatch, or `rpm -K` failure is a hard stop. Recovery requires
an explicit vendor decision or a controlled lock refresh that bumps the NEVRA,
URL, and SHA-256 together. Do not substitute a rebuild, EPEL package, rpmrebuild
output, metadata fallback, or newer z-stream just to keep the build green.
